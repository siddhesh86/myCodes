Electron Trigger SF:
HLT Z_vts SF:
the MC efficiency is one so the efficiency of the online Z region cut in the HLT and the scale factor for MC are identical
events selected using electron triggers which use pixel matching require an additional scale factor. As it is event level, it should be applied only once per event, no matter how many electrons were required to be triggered
this only needs to be applied in 2017, 2016 & 2018 are fine
